# My very own portfolio

This is the source code of my personal, website, which hosts a brief description of myself, my projects and ways to contact me.

## How is it done ?

I used React to develop this front-only website. I am not a web developer, so the code may be not absolutely perfect..

## Is it hosted somewhere ?

I use codesandbox to develop the website (to be able to develop anywhere as quickly as possible and for it to be publicly available from a sharing link).

But as the first version isnt really finished and polished as I want it to be, it is not really hosted for now.

## Any questions or suggestions ?

Please contact me at julien.letheno@gmail.com

Thanks
