# My very own portfolio

This is the source code of my personal, website, which hosts a brief description of myself, my projects and ways to contact me.

## How is it done ?

I used React to develop this front-only website. 

## Is it hosted somewhere ?

Yes of course : head to lethenju.github.io to see it up and running ! Please not this is the adress of the production code, and not the dev one, so it could be slightly different.

## Any questions or suggestions ?

Please contact me at julien.letheno@gmail.com

Thanks
