 
The terminal console is a wonderful tool, isnt it ?

Without any X Window server, you can do plenty of things by typing commands. You can ask your computer to do pretty much anything.. 

But what if you want more ? If you want to play a game, or if you want a nice user interface, the terminal doesnt give you that.. But it can !

## Here comes Termlib

Thats why I developped TermLib, a library to build user interfaces from the terminal !
Draw shapes, lines, write text anywhere, even make games !
It is really simple to use, as you can see in the example I put on github.

It uses LogSystem, another of my projects, to log the errors in a log server, (because of course the terminal is already used for the UI)

## What I learned

I am aware that it probably already exists, but coding it myself helped me to gain experience with C development.
