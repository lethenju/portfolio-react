## Description
A simple bash script give you an API (by parameters) to add, delete, update and get data to a 
specific base.
It is made, like SQL, by tables in bases that you populate, and everything gets written in 
one file.
A concurrency mechanism protects everything if several instances of Databash are using the same file
at the same time.
## What I learned
I learned a lot and gained experience in regex manipulation with sed, and perl.
I also got experienced in bash scripting.
