A simple framework for designing state machines in Go

## What is it ?

You like to design state machines but you dont want to waste time with the implementation ? 
This project aim to answer your needs and provide an easy way to design your state machines based programs very easily.

## Cool ! How can I use it ?

You need to declare your state machine first before playing with it. I will be working on 
dynamic state setup later.

Any questions ?
