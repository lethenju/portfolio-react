Make side projects for fun is a nice thing to do, but to share them with the world is even nicer in my opinions.
My projects may not be the best in their categories, but I try to do things properly, and I learn a lot along the way.

I am not a web developer, but I love learning new things, and this is no exceptions. I already knew basic html css and js of course, as any software engineer getting out of school, but I never had the opportunity to build a website that would actually be on the internet.

I'm not a pro of javascript, nor do I particularly like its design principles, but the functionnal part of it is quite cool, one must admit.

## How did I made it

I firstly mocked the pages on photoshop, then identify the react components to build and their behavious, before actually implementing it, then fixing the problems I saw with the implementation, and incrementally add new projects and features.

I used ReactJS as I already played with it quite some time ago and I really like the features it offers, especially modern ones as hooks.
The effects on the tiles are made with react-spring, and I really like the effect it gives.

## What did I learn

Of course, modern javascript, ReactJS, a lot of css too (especially media queries for responsive designs).
