I like state machines, I like their formalism, their ability to simply modelise a yet complex system.
They serve the understanding of a system, but also its setup, may it be to modelise it before development, as a demo, or directly as the spine of the system.

State machines are incredible tools, and I wanted to make my own library to build some simple applications from them.

## Here comes GoState

So GoState is a little library that helps you to build your application simply by using states and transitions that you define, and functions which will be called in the states, and during the transitions.

I built a little fizzbuzz, and a mini textual adventure game in the examples, so you can see what that looks like.

## What I learned

This project is the first one I realised in Go, I learned a lot of this langage (even if I didnt go far in the implementation of its advanced syntax, without corouutines, without async stuff etc..)
