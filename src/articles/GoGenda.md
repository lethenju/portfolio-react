It has been some time (actually more than a year) that I log most of the things I do in my day, directly on google agenda.
You may ask, why do I do it ?

I like to have a view on how my days look like, without just relying on my biased point of vue. 
I really love to see if I worked more a day or another. Dont judge me.

And I was logging everything by hand, in the Google Calendar app on my phone, or more frequently on the website.
Adding to that, the UX is pretty bad : to create an event with custom color, you had to create one and then modify the color.
It was also impossible to set up an event from "now", I had to manually redo the 

I wanted to automate a bit this action, as it can be quite overwhelming to have a google calendar tab open at all times..
Also, google gives some cool apis to play with, and this project was the perfect occasion to try it.

## Description

I gained experience with Go development, and OAuth2 security mechanism for the API.
