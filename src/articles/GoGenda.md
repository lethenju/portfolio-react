It has been some time (actually more than a year) that I log most of the things I do in my day, directly on Google Agenda.
You may ask, why do I do it ?

I like to have a view on how my days look like, without just relying on my biased point of vue. 
I really love to see if I worked more a day or another. Dont judge me.

And I was logging everything by hand, in the Google Agenda app on my phone, or more frequently on the website.
Adding to that, the UX is pretty bad : to create an event with custom color, you had to create one and then modify the color.
It was also impossible to set up in one clic an event from "now".

I wanted to automate a bit this action, to simplify it by a large margin.
Also, google gives some cool apis to play with, and this project was the perfect occasion to try them.

## Description

GoGenda is a Go client of Google Agenda used for logging activities. You can use your custom categories and colors in a config.json file,
to fit your needs.

You have now access to many API to start a new activity, stop it, delete it, but also d√©clarer one in the past, or in the future, see your daily activities and many others.
All of that with a very easy to use interface.

## What I learned

I gained experience with Go development, and OAuth2 security mechanism for the API.
